# Gulp Starter

Heavily inspired from https://github.com/vigetlabs/gulp-starter.git, thanks for their work.
Most of the code comes from this repository.


## Notable differences
- use .scss format instead of .sass.
- inject svg sprite in application.html layout.
- use special specification for font icons.
